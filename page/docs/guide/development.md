# Development

If you're a developer willing to contribute, be sure to have installed [**Poetry**](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/) and all the dependency packages by running the installation script. Prerequisites for running the script: `gcc`, `g++`, `gmp`, `npm`.

To use an existing Cairo 1 compiler repository, set the environment variable `CAIRO_1_COMPILER_MANIFEST` to the path of the `Cargo.toml` of the compiler. If this variable is not set, the installation script will download a new compiler repository as a subdirectory of your starknet-devnet directory. This compiler downloading is mainly intended to be used by the CI/CD pipeline, but developers can locally depend on it if they want to.

```bash
$ ./scripts/install_dev_tools.sh
```

## Development - Run

```text
$ poetry run starknet-devnet
```

## Development - Run in debug mode

This will restart Devnet on each code change:

```text
$ ./scripts/starknet_devnet_debug.sh
```

## Development - Format and Lint

```text
$ ./scripts/format.sh
$ ./scripts/lint.sh
```

## Development - Test

When running tests locally, do it from the project root.

First generate the artifacts:

```bash
$ ./scripts/compile_contracts.sh
```

To run the tests, use one of these commands:

```bash
$ ./scripts/test.sh [TEST_CASE] # parallelized testing - using auto detected number of CPU cores

$ poetry run pytest -s -v test/ # for more verbose output

$ poetry run pytest test/<TEST_FILE> # for a single file

$ poetry run pytest test/<TEST_FILE>::<TEST_CASE> # for a single test case
```

:::info

To enable testing of custom recompilation, set the environment variable `CAIRO_1_COMPILER_MANIFEST` to the path of the Cargo.toml file of your local Cairo 1 compiler. If you do not set this variable, that test group will fail.

:::info

If you are experiencing test failures on macOS related to `fork()` command
consider running `export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES` in your shell.

## Development - Check versioning consistency

```
$./scripts/check_versions.sh
```

## Development - Adapting to a new version of cairo-lang

Install the exact version with `poetry add cairo-lang@<VERSION>`.

If you only know the URL of the archive (e.g. ZIP) of a new cairo-lang version, you can install it with

```
$ poetry add <URL>
```

Why are we installing the exact version? We depend on Starknet's internal code, and any minor change might make Devnet unusable. E.g. a missing or moved function in a patch version of cairo-lang.

The cairo compiler version (git tag) might need to be changed, both for your local development (git checkout in your compiler repo) and in the CI (in install_dev_tools.sh).

After adding a new cairo-lang version, you need to recompile contract artifacts.

Check if the Solidity contracts have been updated.

When adapting to a new cairo-lang version, to make the tests pass, some hashes will need to be replaced (at least a different version string is stored in the compilation artifacts, leading to a different hash). This is the main argument for keeping the hardcoded hash values in tests: they are only expected to change if a new version cairo-lang version is being added or there is a change with the smart contracts themselves, otherwise a change in the expected hash values probably indicates a bug.

## Development - Updating accounts

1. Set up https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/ locally

   - `git clone ... && pip install cairo-nile && nile init`

2. `git checkout` to desired version
3. `nile compile --directory src`
4. Copy and minify `artifacts/Account.json` and `artifacts/abi/Account.json`
5. Update the precalculated hash

   - Predeployed account addresses should be intact

6. Update directory/file names containing the version
7. Adapt to ABI changes
8. Update expected test paths and addresses
9. Update docs

## Development - Predeployment

Several things are preconfigured on startup to be available on the first user interaction with Devnet. This is done in the `initialize` method of `StarknetWrapper`. The following is currently executed:

- Deployment of
  - Fee token contract
  - User accounts
  - Chargeable account
    - for e.g. signing minting txs
  - UDC
    - supports contract deployment ever since deploy txs have been deprecated
- Declaration of the account class used by Starknet CLI

## Development - Build

You don't need to build anything to be able to run locally, but if you need the `*.whl` or `*.tar.gz` artifacts, run

```text
$ poetry build
```

## Development - Version release

You can check the current version on master with these commands:

```text
$ git checkout master
$ poetry version
```

To update the version use:

```
$ poetry version <VERSION>
```

or any other variation of that [command](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version)

In `starknet_devnet/__init__.py` you need to manually update the version:

```
__version__ = "<VERSION>"
```

If you did everything correctly, these commands should result in the same version:

```
$ poetry version
$ poetry run starknet-devnet --version
```

Commit (Notice the `v`):

```
$ git add starknet_devnet/__init__.py pyproject.toml
$ git commit -m "Bump version to v<VERSION>"
$ git push
```

If the CI/CD pipeline ran successfully, tag the new version:

```
$ git tag v<VERSION>
$ git push origin v<VERSION>
```

Documentation is deployed automatically to https://0xspaceshard.github.io/starknet-devnet:

- Uses the FabijanC username and its private GitHub token set in the CircleCI project env vars.
- Done only after a new version is released.
- Initiated in `scripts/package_build_and_publish.sh`.

Lastly:

- Check if tests and version/image publishing ran successfully on CI
- Generate release notes with the corresponding tag version on GitHub
- Inform users on Telegram, [Discord Devnet channel](https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/985824027950055434), and [Starknet Shamans](https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-devnet/69).
