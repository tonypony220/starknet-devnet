## Install

```text
pip install starknet-devnet
```

### Requirements

Works with Python versions >=3.8 and <3.10.

On Ubuntu/Debian, first run:

```text
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev
```

On Mac, you can use `brew`:

```text
brew install gmp
```

## Disclaimer

- Devnet should not be used as a replacement for Alpha testnet. After testing on Devnet, be sure to test on testnet (alpha-goerli)!
- Specifying a block by its hash/number is not supported for contract calls. All interaction is done with the latest block.
- There is no pending block. A new block is generated with each transaction.
- Sending transactions with max_fee set to 0 is supported (not supported on alpha-mainnet or alpha-goerli).
- Devnet is currently being adapted to Starknet and Cairo v0.10.0, if you spot any issues, please [report them](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/issues/new/choose)

## Run

Installing the package adds the `starknet-devnet` command.

```text
usage: starknet-devnet [-h] [-v] [--host HOST] [--port PORT]

Run a local instance of Starknet Devnet

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Print the version
  --host HOST           Specify the address to listen at; defaults to
                        127.0.0.1 (use the address the program outputs on
                        start)
  --port PORT, -p PORT  Specify the port to listen at; defaults to 5050
  --load-path LOAD_PATH

  --timeout TIMEOUT, -t TIMEOUT
                        Specify the server timeout in seconds; defaults to 60
```

You can run `starknet-devnet` in a separate shell, or you can run it in background with `starknet-devnet &`.
Check that it's alive by running the following (address and port my vary if you specified a different one with `--host` or `--port`):

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:5050/is_alive
```

## Run with Docker

Devnet is available as a Docker image `shardlabs/starknet-devnet` ([Docker Hub link](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/shardlabs/starknet-devnet)). Fetch it by running:

```text
docker pull shardlabs/starknet-devnet:<TAG>
```

### Versions and Tags

Devnet versions, as tracked on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/starknet-devnet/#history), are also the tags for the corresponding images:

- `shardlabs/starknet-devnet:<VERSION>`

The latest stable version is also available as:

- `shardlabs/starknet-devnet:latest`

Commits to the `master` branch of this repository are mostly available as images tagged with their commit hash (the full 40-hex-digits SHA1 digest):

- `shardlabs/starknet-devnet:<COMMIT_HASH>`

The last commit is also a candidate for the next release, so it is available as:

- `shardlabs/starknet-devnet:next`

So far, all listed tags referred to images built for the linux/amd64 architecture. To use arm64-compatible images, append `-arm` to the tag. E.g.:

- `shardlabs/starknet-devnet:<VERSION>-arm`
- `shardlabs/starknet-devnet:latest-arm`

By appending the `-seed0` suffix, you can use images which [predeploy funded accounts](#predeployed-accounts) with `--seed 0`, thus always deploying the same set of accounts. E.g.:

- `shardlabs/starknet-devnet:<VERSION>-seed0`
- `shardlabs/starknet-devnet:latest-seed0`
- `shardlabs/starknet-devnet:next-seed0`
- `shardlabs/starknet-devnet:<VERSION>-arm-seed0`

### Container port publishing

#### Linux

If on a Linux host machine, you can use [`--network host`](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/). This way, the port used internally by the container is also available on your host machine. The `--port` option also has effect.

```text
docker run --network host shardlabs/starknet-devnet [--port <PORT>]
```

#### Mac, Windows

If not on Linux, you need to publish the container's internally used port to a desired `<PORT>` on your host machine. The internal port is `5050` by default (can be overriden with `--port`).

```text
docker run -p [HOST:]<PORT>:5050 shardlabs/starknet-devnet
```

E.g. if you want to use your host machine's `127.0.0.1:5050`, you need to run:

```text
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5050:5050 shardlabs/starknet-devnet
```

You may ignore any address-related output logged on container startup (e.g. `Running on all addresses` or `Running on http://172.17.0.2:5050`). What you will use is what you specified with the `-p` argument.

If you don't specify the `HOST` part, the server will indeed be available on all of your host machine's addresses (localhost, local network IP, etc.), which may present a security issue if you don't want anyone from the local network to access your Devnet instance.

## Interaction

- Interact with Devnet as you would with the official Starknet [Alpha testnet](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/amm.html?highlight=alpha#interaction-examples).
- The exact underlying API is not exposed for the same reason Alpha testnet does not expose it.
- To use Devnet with Starknet CLI, provide Devnet's URL to the `--gateway_url` and `--feeder_gateway_url` options of Starknet CLI commands.
- The following Starknet CLI commands are supported:
  - `call`
  - `declare`
  - `deploy`
  - `estimate_fee`
  - `estimate_message_fee`
  - `get_block` (currently pending block is not supported)
  - `get_block_traces`
  - `get_class_by_hash`
  - `get_class_hash_at`
  - `get_code`
  - `get_full_contract`
  - `get_nonce`
  - `get_state_update`
  - `get_storage_at`
  - `get_transaction`
  - `get_transaction_receipt`
  - `get_transaction_trace`
  - `invoke`
  - `tx_status`
- The following Starknet CLI commands are **not** supported:
  - `get_contract_addresses`

## JSON-RPC API

Devnet also partially supports JSON-RPC API v0.1.0: [specifications](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/releases/tag/v0.1.0) . It can be reached under `/rpc`. For an example:

```
POST /rpc
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "starknet_getBlockTransactionCount",
  "params": {
    "block_id": "latest"
  },
  "id": 0
}
```

Response:

```
{
  "id": 0,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": 1
}
```

Methods currently not supported:

- `starknet_protocolVersion` - will be removed in a future version of the specification
- `starknet_getEvents`
- `starknet_getNonce`

## Hardhat integration

If you're using [the Hardhat plugin](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin), see [here](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin#runtime-network) on how to edit its config file to integrate Devnet.

## Postman integration

Postman is a Starknet utility that allows testing L1 <> L2 interaction. To utilize this, you can use [`starknet-hardhat-plugin`](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin), as witnessed in [this example](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-example/blob/master/test/postman.test.ts). Or you can directly interact with the two Postman-specific endpoints:

### Postman - Load

```
POST /postman/load_l1_messaging_contract
{
  "networkUrl": "http://localhost:8545",
  "address": "0x123...def"
}
```

Loads a `StarknetMockMessaging` contract. The `address` parameter is optional; if provided, the `StarknetMockMessaging` contract will be fetched from that address, otherwise a new one will be deployed.

`networkUrl` is the URL of the JSON-RPC API of the L1 node you've run locally or that already exists; possibilities include, and are not limited to:

- [Goerli testnet](https://goerli.net/)
- [Ganache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache)
- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#docker-quick-start)
- [Hardhat node](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/#running-stand-alone-in-order-to-support-wallets-and-other-software).

### Postman - Flush

```
POST /postman/flush
```

Goes through the newly enqueued messages, sending them from L1 to L2 and from L2 to L1. Requires no body.

### Postman - disclaimer

This method of L1 <> L2 communication testing differs from Starknet Alpha networks. Taking the [L1L2Example.sol](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/_static/L1L2Example.sol) contract in the [starknet documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/l1l2.html):

```
constructor(IStarknetCore starknetCore_) public {
    starknetCore = starknetCore_;
}
```

The constructor takes an `IStarknetCore` contract as argument, however for Devnet L1 <> L2 communication testing, this will have to be replaced with the [MockStarknetMessaging.sol](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/testing/MockStarknetMessaging.sol) contract:

```
constructor(MockStarknetMessaging mockStarknetMessaging_) public {
    starknetCore = mockStarknetMessaging_;
}
```

## Dumping

To preserve your Devnet instance for future use, there are several options:

- Dumping on exit (handles Ctrl+C, i.e. SIGINT, doesn't handle SIGKILL):

```
starknet-devnet --dump-on exit --dump-path <PATH>
```

- Dumping after each transaction (done in background, doesn't block):

```
starknet-devnet --dump-on transaction --dump-path <PATH>
```

- Dumping on request (replace `<HOST>`, `<PORT>` and `<PATH>` with your own):

```
curl -X POST http://<HOST>:<PORT>/dump -d '{ "path": <PATH> }' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Loading

To load a preserved Devnet instance, the options are:

- Loading on startup:

```
starknet-devnet --load-path <PATH>
```

- Loading on request:

```
curl -X POST http://<HOST>:<PORT>/load -d '{ "path": <PATH> }' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Enabling dumping and loading with Docker

To enable dumping and loading if running Devnet in a Docker container, you must bind the container path with the path on your host machine.

This example:

- Relies on [Docker bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/); try [Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) instead.
- Assumes that `/actual/dumpdir` exists. If unsure, use absolute paths.
- Assumes you are listening on `127.0.0.1:5050`.

If there is `dump.pkl` inside `/actual/dumpdir`, you can load it with:

```
docker run \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5050:5050 \
  --mount type=bind,source=/actual/dumpdir,target=/dumpdir \
  shardlabs/starknet-devnet \
  --load-path /dumpdir/dump.pkl
```

To dump to `/actual/dumpdir/dump.pkl` on Devnet shutdown, run:

```
docker run \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5050:5050 \
  --mount type=bind,source=/actual/dumpdir,target=/dumpdir \
  shardlabs/starknet-devnet \
  --dump-on exit --dump-path /dumpdir/dump.pkl
```

## Block explorer

A local block explorer (Voyager), as noted [here](https://voyager.online/local-version/), apparently cannot be set up to work with Devnet. Read more in [this issue](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/issues/60).

## Blocks

Devnet starts with a genesis block (with block number equal to `0` and block hash equal to `"0x0"`).

A new block is generated with each new transaction. There is no pending block.

### Create an empty block

To create an empty block without transactions, `POST` a request to `/create_block`:

```
POST /create_block
```

Response:

```
{
    "transactions": [],
    "parent_block_hash": "0x0",
    "timestamp": 1659457385,
    "state_root": "004bee3ee...",
    "gas_price": "0x174876e800",
    "sequencer_address": "0x4bbfb0d1aa...",
    "transaction_receipts": [],
    "starknet_version": "0.9.1",
    "block_hash": "0x1",
    "block_number": 1,
    "status": "ACCEPTED_ON_L2"
}
```

## Lite mode

Since Devnet 0.3.0, the effect of lite mode is minimal and only skips block hash calculation (replacing it with iterative numbering: `0x0`, `0x1`, `0x2`, ...). Activate it by passing `--lite-mode` on startup.

## Restart

Devnet can be restarted by making a `POST /restart` request. All of the deployed contracts, blocks and storage updates will be restarted to the empty state. If you're using [the Hardhat plugin](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin#restart), run `await starknet.devnet.restart()`.

## Advancing time

Block timestamp can be manipulated by seting the exact time or seting the time offset. Timestamps methods won't generate a new block, but they will modify the time of the following blocks. All values should be set in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) and seconds.

### Set time

Sets the exact time of the next generated block. All subsequent blocks will keep the set offset.

```
POST /set_time
{
    "time": TIME_IN_SECONDS
}
```

Warning: block time can be set in the past and lead to unexpected behaviour!

### Increase time

Increases the time offset for each generated block.

```
POST /increase_time
{
    "time": TIME_IN_SECONDS
}
```

### Start time arg

Devnet can be started with the `--start-time` argument.

```
starknet-devnet --start-time START_TIME_IN_SECONDS
```

### Timeout

Timeout can be passed to Devnet's HTTP server. This makes it easier to deploy and manage large contracts that take longer to execute and may otherwise result in an error `ServerDisconnectedError`.

```
starknet-devnet --timeout TIMEOUT
```

## Contract debugging

If your contract is using `print` in cairo hints (it was compiled with the `--disable-hint-validation` flag), Devnet will output those lines together with its regular server output. Read more about hints [here](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/how_cairo_works/hints.html). To filter out just your debug lines, redirect stderr to /dev/null when starting Devnet:

```
starknet-devnet 2> /dev/null
```

To disable all the python logging you have to explicitly pass `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=0`:

```sh
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5050:5050 -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=0 shardlabs/starknet-devnet
```

## Predeployed accounts

Devnet predeploys `--accounts` with some `--initial-balance`. The accounts get charged for transactions according to the `--gas-price`. A `--seed` can be used to regenerate the same set of accounts. Read more about it in the [Run section](#run).

To get the code of the account (currently fork of OpenZeppelin's [v0.4.0b](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.4.0b)), use one of the following:

- `GET /get_code?contractAddress=<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>`
- [Starknet CLI](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/cli.html#get-code): `starknet get_code --contract_address <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> --feeder_gateway_url <DEVNET_URL>`
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/cairo-contracts/tree/fix-account-query-version)

You can use the accounts in e.g. [starknet-hardhat-plugin](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin) via:

```typescript
const account = await starknet.getAccountFromAddress(
  ADDRESS,
  PRIVATE_KEY,
  "OpenZeppelin"
);
```

### Fetch predeployed accounts

```
GET /predeployed_accounts
```

Response:

```
[
  {
    "initial_balance": 1e+21,
    "address": "0x7c3e2...",
    "private_key": "0x6160...",
    "public_key": "0x6a5540..."
  },
  ...
]
```

### Fetch account balance

```
GET /account_balance?address=<HEX_ADDRESS>
```

Response:

```
{
  "amount": 123...456,
  "unit": "wei"
}
```

## Mint token - Local faucet

Other than using prefunded predeployed accounts, you can also add funds to an account that you deployed yourself.

The ERC20 contract used for minting ETH tokens and charging fees is at: `0x62230ea046a9a5fbc261ac77d03c8d41e5d442db2284587570ab46455fd2488`

### Query fee token address

```
GET /fee_token
```

Response:

```
{
  "symbol":"ETH",
  "address":"0x62230ea046a9a5fbc261ac77d03c8d41e5d442db2284587570ab46455fd2488",
}
```

### Mint with a transaction

By not setting the `lite` parameter or by setting it to `false`, new tokens will be minted in a separate transaction. You will receive the hash of this transaction, as well as the new balance after minting in the response.

`amount` needs to be an integer (or a float whose fractional part is 0, e.g. `1000.0` or `1e21`)

```
POST /mint
{
    "address": "0x6e3205f...",
    "amount": 500000
}
```

Response:

```
{
    "new_balance": 500000,
    "unit": "wei",
    "tx_hash": "0xa24f23..."
}
```

### Mint lite

By setting the `lite` parameter, new tokens will be minted without generating a transaction, thus executing faster.

```
POST /mint
{
    "address": "0x6e3205f...",
    "amount": 500000,
    "lite": true
}
```

Response:

```
{
    "new_balance": 500000,
    "unit": "wei",
    "tx_hash": null
}
```

## Devnet speed-up troubleshooting

If you are not satisfied with Devnet's performance, consider the following:

- Make sure you are using the latest version of Devnet because new improvements are added regularly.
- Try using [lite-mode](#lite-mode).
- If minting tokens, set the [lite parameter](#mint-lite).
- Using an [installed Devnet](#install) should be faster than [running it with Docker](#run-with-docker).
- If you are [running Devnet with Docker](#run-with-docker) on an ARM machine (e.g. M1), make sure you are using [the appropriate image tag](#versions-and-tags)
- If Devnet has been running for some time, try restarting it (either by killing it or by using the [restart functionality](#restart)).
- Keep in mind that:
  - The first transaction is always a bit slower due to lazy loading.
  - Tools you use for testing (e.g. [the Hardhat plugin](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin)) add their own overhead.
  - Bigger contracts are more time consuming.

## Development

If you're a developer willing to contribute, be sure to have installed [Poetry](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/) and all the dependency packages by running the following script. You are expected to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```text
./scripts/install_dev_tools.sh
```

### Development - Run

```text
poetry run starknet-devnet
```

### Development - Run in debug mode

```text
./scripts/starknet_devnet_debug.sh
```

### Development - Format and lint

```text
./scripts/format.sh
./scripts/lint.sh
```

### Development - Test

When running tests locally, do it from the project root:

First generate the artifacts:

```bash
./scripts/compile_contracts.sh
```

Use one of the testing commands:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh [TEST_CASE] # parallelized testing - using auto detected number of CPU cores

poetry run pytest -s -v test/ # for more verbose output

poetry run pytest test/<TEST_FILE> # for a single file

poetry run pytest test/<TEST_FILE>::<TEST_CASE> # for a single test case
```

### Development - Check versioning consistency

```
./scripts/check_versions.sh
```

### Development - Working with a local version of cairo-lang

In `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` specify

```
cairo-lang = { path = "your-cairo-lang-package.zip" }
```

### Development - Updating accounts

1. Set up https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/ locally

   - `git clone ... && pip install cairo-nile && nile init`

2. `git checkout` to desired version
3. `nile compile --directory src`
4. Copy and minify `artifacts/Account.json` and `artifacts/abi/Account.json`
5. Update the precalculated hash

   - Predeployed account addresses should be intact

6. Update directory/file names containing the version
7. Update expected test paths and addresses
8. Update docs

### Development - Build

You don't need to build anything to be able to run locally, but if you need the `*.whl` or `*.tar.gz` artifacts, run

```text
poetry build
```

### Development - Version release

You can check the current version on master with these commands:
```
git checkout master
poetry version
```

To update the version use:
```
poetry version <VERSION>
```
or any other variation of that [command](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version)

In file `/starknet_devnet/__init__.py` you need to manually update the version:
```
__version__ = "<VERSION>"
```

If you did everything correctly these commands should result with the same version:
```
poetry version
poetry run starknet-devnet --version
```

Later, add a tag to the version update commit (Notice the `v`):
```
git tag v<VERSION>
git push origin v<VERSION>
```

Lastly:
- check if CI and image publish worked after commit
- generate release notes with the corresponding tag version on GitHub
- inform users on telegram, devnet channel in starkware discord, and [Starknet Shamans](https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-devnet/69).
